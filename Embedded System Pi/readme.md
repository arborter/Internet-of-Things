A mock OS for an IoT system, namely in home light control. 

Once the PICO is in a power source, the interface requests a password, after 3 attempts of which the user is locked out and alerted through the analog red LED.

A person can click on numerous analog inputs which dictate the power of lights. User can request the temperature through analog input, after which the temperature would appear on the interface.

This microcontroller can be linked to a network, after which logs would appear on the server.
